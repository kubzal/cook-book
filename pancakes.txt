Ingredients
1 cup all-purpose flour

2 tablespoons sugar

2 teaspoons baking powder

1/2 teaspoon salt

1 cup milk

1 large egg

2 tablespoons melted butter (or oil)

Instructions
Mix Dry: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

Mix Wet: In a separate bowl, whisk the egg, milk, and melted butter together.

Combine: Pour the wet ingredients into the dry. Stir until just combined. It’s okay if there are a few small lumps; over-mixing makes them tough.

Cook: Heat a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake.

Flip: When bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set (about 2–3 minutes), flip and cook the other side until golden brown.

Tip: If you want them extra fluffy, let the batter sit for 5 minutes before you start cooking!
